PARLOR
This is the parlor.
It's a beautiful room.

There looks to be a kitchen to the "north".
And there's a shadowy corridor to the "east".

KITCHEN
There is a long countertop with dirty dishes everywhere. Off to one side
there is, as you'd expect, a refrigerator. You may open the "refrigerator"
or "go back".

CORRIDOR
The corridor has led to a dark room. The moment you step inside, the door
slams shut behind you. There is no handle on the interior of the door.

There is no escaping. Type "quit" to die.

REFRIGERATOR
Inside the refrigerator you see food and stuff. It looks pretty nasty.
You can "eat" some of the food or go "back".

EATFOOD
The food is slimy and foul, but you manage to choke it down. Your stomach
starts jumping like a frog in hot water. You feel faint. Sliding to the
floor, the darkness closes in.

You have died.
(Type "quit" to die.)
